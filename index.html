        <div class="col s12"><blockquote>For me, it was knowing that I don’t have to be a certain way or certain image to other people. That really helped me explore all the different ways of being. Physical health, mental health, and wealth are all concepts that once you understand, you can have. The artist life can be very abstract, demanding and challenging, but it can also be extremely rewarding. It’s an alchemy. You work with many different energies, thoughts and manifestations, and in the end, you choose what you need.</blockquote></div>
        <div class="col s12"><blockquote>To me, being an artist is not a profession. It’s a spaceship that one travels in. You are following your own trajectory. It’s a self study. I am learning about the self, the conditions of the I, and the spaces around it. To learn about the self is an extremely important process in a person’s development, and art was my teacher. Art provided many questions and some of the answers. I am really taking my time with it. It took me a long time to arrive to what is now considered my style. And then it just came. It was so easy and effortless. I recognised myself in the work I was doing, and it became my style.</blockquote></div>
        <div class="col s12"><blockquote>In life, we have so many different roles and responsibilities that we have to fulfil –  being a friend, a mother, a daughter, a professional, and so on. Some of them we get to choose, and some of it chooses us. All of us on this planet have exactly the same amount of hours in the day, and it’s up to us what we choose to do with them. Whenever I start to feel overwhelmed, I slow down and I end up doing more. The best advice I heard was: “learn to rest, not to quit.”</blockquote></div>
        <div class="col s12"><blockquote>keep a clear mind, to stay focused on what makes you happy, to be kind to yourself and others, and then just show up for what needs to be done. Don’t wait for that mythical, magical day when you will start living your life. Show up now. Turn up at the gym and do something, turn up at the market and buy food that’s good for you, turn up at the studio and create.</blockquote></div>

            <p>High performers constantly seek clarity. That makes them better at sifting out distractions because they constantly refocus on what is important.</p>

            <p>High performers have mastered their transitions. They're more likely to take a quick break, to close their eyes, to meditate -- to give themselves a short psychological break that releases their tension and focus from one activity so they are primed to take on the next. They recharge themselves throughout the day, between activities -- it's as if they generate energy throughout the day instead of losing it.</p>

          <div class="col s6">
            <p class="right-align">High performers develop influence by teaching people how to think and challenging them to grow.</p>
            <p class="right-align">High performers say things like, "Think of it this way" or "What if we approached it this way?" or "What do you think about this?" Over time, they train the people around them how to think -- because when you impact someone else's thoughts in a positive way, you have influence.</p>
            <p class="right-align">Think of an influential person in your life. They taught you how to think about yourself, or about others, or about the world, and they also challenged you to grow.</p>
            <p class="right-align">Why was this person so influential? They inspired you. How? They pushed you. How did they push you? They always told you to be your best. High performers challenge the people they care about to grow.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s6">
              <p>Before every major activity, high performers raise the psychological necessity regarding why it is important for them to perform well. They all tell themselves why it's important for them to succeed at whatever they do that day. They all associate a deep sense of identity with performing with excellence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col s6">
              <p class="right-align">First, they speak up for themselves. They share their truth and ambitions more often than other people do. They also speak up for other people more often than others do. In short, high performers are willing to share the truth about themselves.</p>
              <p class="right-align">They "honor the struggle." Sometimes they use different language to describe the phenomena. Some say they are "patient through the process." Others say they're "OK with other people doubting or judging them." ...each of them has an almost reverence for the hardship: They honor the struggle as necessary to forge the kind of character that will help them deserve the outcome they desire.</p>
              <p class="right-align">High performers have also identified someone to fight for. Courage comes from wanting to serve one person or one unit: wife, husband, family, a small group of people. The will to work through uncertainty or fear comes from wanting to serve someone who needs help.</p>

          <blockquote>"...think about these two common objects. They're both made of carbon, and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphite, which is soft and dark. But if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way, you get diamond, which is clear and hard. And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness do not reside in the carbon atoms; they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms, or at least arise because of the interconnections between the carbon atoms. So, similarly, the pattern of connections among people confers upon the groups of people different properties..."</blockquote>
          <blockquote>"...the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism. Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to, and by studying, the collective. Like, for example, a hive of bees that's finding a new nesting site, or a flock of birds that's evading a predator, or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the Pacific, or a pack of wolves that's able to bring down larger prey. Superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals. I think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena -- like crime, and warfare, and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption."</blockquote>
          <blockquote><em>..."I think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs. If I was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs, you would cut the ties to me, and the network would disintegrate. So the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks."</em></blockquote>
