            <p>For me, it was knowing that I don’t have to be a certain way or certain image to other people. That really helped me explore all the different ways of being. Physical health, mental health, and wealth are all concepts that once you understand, you can have. The artist life can be very abstract, demanding and challenging, but it can also be extremely rewarding. It’s an alchemy. You work with many different energies, thoughts and manifestations, and in the end, you choose what you need.
To me, being an artist is not a profession. It’s a spaceship that one travels in. You are following your own trajectory. It’s a self study. I am learning about the self, the conditions of the I, and the spaces around it. To learn about the self is an extremely important process in a person’s development, and art was my teacher. Art provided many questions and some of the answers. I am really taking my time with it. It took me a long time to arrive to what is now considered my style. And then it just came. It was so easy and effortless. I recognised myself in the work I was doing, and it became my style.
In life, we have so many different roles and responsibilities that we have to fulfil – being a friend, a mother, a daughter, a professional, and so on. Some of them we get to choose, and some of it chooses us. All of us on this planet have exactly the same amount of hours in the day, and it’s up to us what we choose to do with them. Whenever I start to feel overwhelmed, I slow down and I end up doing more. The best advice I heard was: “learn to rest, not to quit.”
keep a clear mind, to stay focused on what makes you happy, to be kind to yourself and others, and then just show up for what needs to be done. Don’t wait for that mythical, magical day when you will start living your life. Show up now. Turn up at the gym and do something, turn up at the market and buy food that’s good for you, turn up at the studio and create.</p>
